# Color-Detection-using-Python
In this color detection Python project, you can select any image and click at any point and get its name. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

The project folder contains 3 files:

Color_detection.py – main source code of our project.
Colorpic.jpg – sample image for experimenting.
Colors.csv – a file that contains our dataset.

The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.

Steps to run the project:
1. Download and unzip the zip file
2. Open cmd at the location of this particular file and type the below command:

python color_detection.py -i <add your image path here>  //add the complete image path
